a) Multiplies two matrices using
   * Tiling
   * Transposing of the second matrice for faster memory access
   And has acutally a bug of transposing the second matrix beforehand.
b) Fits a Gaussian function to a number of randomly generated points, using
TMinuit of the ROOT package and a device function involving Thrust.
